        Hi, My name is Leo Pignanelli, I am currently a student at the
        University of Utah's Professional Education Bootcamp for Full Stack Web
        Development. What's better than owning your own home? 
        <strong> Owning your own Home Page!! </strong> 
        Who needs a house when you can just program out in the street. 
        Maybe a passing Oracle will toss me a job. I have been spending the last 2 years fine tuning my skills
        in JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and React.js. My forte is backend.
        Im skilled in the usage of MySQL, MongoDB, Apollo, Insomnia, and TablePlus. I
        currently live in Mccammon, Idaho with my wife and 2 children. In 5 years I
        hope to be established in a backend engineering career, working my days
        away at home.
